#  House Price Prediction

##  Project Summary

This project predicts house prices based on key features like **number of bedrooms**, **postcode**, **property type**, and **year of sale**. I built and compared multiple regression models and used **Random Forest Regressor** to achieve high prediction accuracy.

>  Final Model R¬≤ Score: **0.702**  
>  RMSE: **‚Çπ141,851.55**

##  Problem Statement

Real estate agents want to estimate housing prices using past sales data. The aim is to create a machine learning model that can **predict the selling price** of a property based on specific characteristics.

## üßæ Features Used

| Feature        | Type        | Description                             |
|----------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `bedrooms`      | Numerical   | Number of bedrooms in the property      |
| `propertyType`  | Categorical | Type of property (e.g., House or Unit)  |
| `postcode`      | Categorical | Area code representing location         |
| `yearsold`      | Numerical   | Year extracted from `datesold` column   |

 **Target Variable**: `price` (log-transformed to reduce skew)

---

##  EDA Insights

- `price` is **right-skewed**, so log transformation was applied.
- More bedrooms = higher price (positive trend).
- **Houses** tend to sell at **higher prices** than units.
- Property prices increased over years ‚Üí added `yearSold` feature.

##  Models Compared

| Model              | R¬≤ Score | RMSE (‚Çπ)      |
|--------------------|----------|---------------|
| Linear Regression  | 0.662    | ‚Çπ151,237.28   |
| **Random Forest**  | **0.702**| **‚Çπ141,851.55** |

Final model: **Random Forest Regressor** due to better performance.
